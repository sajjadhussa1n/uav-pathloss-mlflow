# UAV Pathloss Prediction with MSFF-UNet and MLflow

This repository provides code and resources for training and evaluating a **Multi-Scale Feature Fusion U-Net (MSFF-UNet)** model for UAV-assisted mmWave communications.  
It includes:
- Model architecture implementation in TensorFlow/Keras.
- Dataset preparation and loading utilities.
- Training and evaluation pipeline with MLflow integration.
- Pre-trained weights and processed dataset for reproducibility.

## ðŸ“– Overview

Accurate pathloss prediction is critical for UAV-assisted wireless communication systems.  
We propose a **UNet-based architecture with multi-scale feature fusion (MSFF-UNet)** to predict pathloss using 3D geometry, line-of-sight (LOS) masks, and building layout information.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

You can run the pipeline either:
- On **Google Colab** (quick start, recommended for testing), or
- Locally via **CLI** (VS Code, terminal, etc.).
